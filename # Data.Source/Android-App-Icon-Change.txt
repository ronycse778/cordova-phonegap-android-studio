Android App Icon Change
==========================

This solution are from net sources, but I do it in simple way.
Ready a logo with 128x128 or 256x256 or 512x512. jpg or png. 
And follow icon-change snapshots provided in this folder.

Bellow things are not necessary.

To change the app icon in Android Studio, you'll need to replace the default launcher icons with your custom icons. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Prepare Your Icon Assets
Ensure your icon images are ready in different resolutions to support various screen densities:

mdpi (48x48 pixels)
hdpi (72x72 pixels)
xhdpi (96x96 pixels)
xxhdpi (144x144 pixels)
xxxhdpi (192x192 pixels)

2. Open the Project in Android Studio
Open your project in Android Studio.
Navigate to the res folder in the Project view, typically located under app/src/main/res.

3. Using Image Asset Studio
Right-click the res folder and go to New > Image Asset.
In the Asset Type dropdown, select Launcher Icons (Adaptive and Legacy).
In the Path section, click on the folder icon and select your custom image file.
Configure the icon type, background, and other settings as needed.
Click Next and then Finish.
Android Studio will generate the necessary icon files and update the mipmap- folders accordingly.

4. Verify the Changes
Open the AndroidManifest.xml file located in app/src/main/.
Ensure the <application> tag has the correct android:icon attribute pointing to the updated icon, usually like this:
xml
Copy code
<application
    android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
    ...>
Run your app on an emulator or physical device to verify the icon change.

5. Check for Adaptive Icons
If your app supports Android 8.0 (API level 26) or higher, you can also configure adaptive icons. This involves specifying a foreground and background layer.

Adaptive icons consist of two layers: a foreground and a background.
The foreground can be an image, while the background can be a color or another image.
For more customization, you can manually edit the ic_launcher.xml files located in the res/mipmap-anydpi directory.

6. Rebuild and Test
After making these changes, clean and rebuild your project to ensure that the new icons are applied correctly. You can clean and rebuild your project by selecting Build > Clean Project and then Build > Rebuild Project from the top menu.
